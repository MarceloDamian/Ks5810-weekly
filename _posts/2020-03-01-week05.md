<p align="center"><b>Comments on Project Evaluation</b></p>
<p align="center">
    Umar, Mohammed and I did an <a href="https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-
    spr-2020/project-evaluation/blob/master/vscode_evaluation.md">evaluation</a>
    on vscode, which is a Microsoft's open sourced IDE. I tried the editor
    before, and though it was super light and snappy, I personally did not love
    it. However, it's worth knowing it since I hear about it everywhere, and
    these are positive most of the time.

##### General Impression

As we look into the repository of the project, we found out the project is huge!
(as everyone expected). It has 639,878 lines of code and 1099 contributors. We
browsed through some files, and their documentation looks clear and concise. The
code is also self descriptive and well commented, from a judgement based on our
random sample. Another remarkable fact is, 93.7% of its code is Typescript. My
guess was it's mostly written in JavaScript, since I only knew that
[Electron][ELECTRON] (A framework which enables you to write desktop
applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript) project. However, I thought typeScript
is such a new technology that everyone is currently trying to migrate to, so the
rate is surprising. Contributing to this project seems exiting if you use vscode
regular bases.


##### The Hard Part

We also did some research for some numbers in the project. The hardest part of
this evaluation was finding ways to count, or filter the numbers. We initially
tried to count all the issues in past six month, but after running around in
github docs, finally found there is a thing called search syntax. It was shame
on me that I didn't come up with this because I sometime use something similar
to this on Twitter. Anyway, it is a great feature when you want to know about a
repository, or to search in github in general. Here is an example of the
functionality. For example, If you are to find how many issues were closed in
the past six months. Let's assume that today's date is 2020-02-29, then click on
`Issues` tab in the repository, then, in the search bar right next to Filters
pull down, type:
```
is:issue is:closed :>2019-08-29
```
where `:` divides a qualifier (specifying which function to use) and a parameter
(specifies type of value to search). You may refer to the [the
documentation][GH_SEARCH_DOC] for more details. These syntax can be expanded to
general search as well, such as finding a repository. Furthermore, there is a
api called [github api][GH_API] which you can make a http request with headers
that specify the values you need, but it is obviously an overkill for simple
evaluations.
